# coding-practice
This repository is for uploading codes during and after data analyst/scientist lectures.
## CAVEAT:
1. Several codes and explanations in this github repository are written in Korean. For understanding explanations, translation via Google Translate or other tools might be necessary. Meanwhile, for importing/exporting/executing necessary codes written in Korean (particularly .sql files) without any broken words, you might need to take necessary measures via Googling.
